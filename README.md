# CatBlock üê±

[‰∏≠ÊñáËØ¥Êòé](./readme_cn.md)

## What if we... Block Ads with black kittens?

A quick vibe coding project for lols	.


## What is this?

CatBlock is a Chrome extension that replaces web advertisements with cute black cat pictures. Instead of seeing ads, you'll see adorable black kittens working hard to protect your browsing experience.

**Important Note**: This is NOT a serious ad blocker! It's just a fun project I made for laughs and to bring some feline joy to the internet. Don't rely on it for privacy or security purposes.

## How it works

1. The extension detects common ad elements on web pages
2. It runs a fun "scanning" animation to show cats at work
3. It replaces the ad with a randomly selected black cat image
4. You get to enjoy browsing with fewer ads and more cats!

## Features

- Cute scanning animation with a "cat is working..." message
- Supports different cat image formats for different ad sizes (wide, tall, square)
- Works on popular sites like YouTube, Zhihu, Baidu, and Bilibili

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the cloned repository folder
5. Enjoy your cat-filled browsing experience!
